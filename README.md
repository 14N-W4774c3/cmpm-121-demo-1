## Summary
### This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

## Credits
### Addition of background inspired by Yazmin's Soul Reaper (https://github.com/YazmynS/cmpm-121-demo-1/tree/main)
### Reorganization of UI elements inspired by ykijel's Spooky Clicker (https://github.com/ykijel/cmpm-121-demo-1)

## Devlog 11/16
### Figures.  I manage to get the Demo assignment reopened, only to break my solution trying to get D1.c and D1.d done.
### The project worked at Step 10, though it lacked the tracker for purchase quantity of items.
### This update should have fixed the bugs that cropped up in the first few commits afterwards, as well as implementing the missing tracker.
### If the upgrade buttons still refuse to enable... well, I tried.  I can't keep getting mired down in this.
