This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.
Addition of background inspired by Yazmin's Soul Reaper (https://github.com/YazmynS/cmpm-121-demo-1/tree/main)
Reorganization of UI elements inspired by ykijel's Spooky Clicker (https://github.com/ykijel/cmpm-121-demo-1)
